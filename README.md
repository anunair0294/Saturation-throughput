# Saturation-throughput

### Section 1 : Matlab code folder contains two files 

* File 1 : Case A :  bianchi_analysisCaseA.m
    * To run this function :
    * [Throughput,Throughput_perNode] = bianchi_analysisCaseA(cwMin,N) 
    * enter cwMin = 1 and N = any number of nodes, cwMax in the function is taken as 1023 ( m = 10).
* File 2 : Case B :  bianchi_analysisCaseB.m
     * To run this function :
     * [Throughput,Throughput_perNode] = bianchi_analysisCaseB(cwMin,N) 
     * enter cwMin = 63 and N = any number of nodes, cwMax in the function is taken as 1023 ( m = 10).
